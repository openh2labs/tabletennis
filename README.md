Open source table tennis client

Welcome to the open source table tennis data collection client

We are a community of developers working on an open source client used to collect game results of teams and players for various communities (Schools, offices etc)

It's built using laravel as a back end, nodejs and reactjs

Special thanks to the good people at browserstack https://www.browserstack.com/ for providing device and browser testing for this open source project.
